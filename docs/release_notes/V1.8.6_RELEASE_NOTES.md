## ✨ New Features

### Temporary Tabs (Preview Mode) 🆕

**Single-click vs Double-click behavior:**
- **Single-click** on a request in Collections → Opens in **temporary tab** (italic text)
- **Double-click** on a request → Opens in **permanent tab** (normal text)
- **Only one temporary tab** can exist at a time
- Temporary tab converts to permanent when you:
  - **Edit the request** (start typing)
  - **Send the request**
  - **Save the request**
  - **Double-click** to explicitly make it permanent

**Benefits:**
- Browse requests quickly without cluttering tabs
- Preview requests before committing to open them
- More efficient tab management for large collections
- Similar to VS Code's file preview behavior

---

### History Panel as Overlay 📋

- No more modal dialog blocking your workflow

  - **Add Collection Variable** - Add to a collection

**Workflow:**
1. Click **"+ Add"** button in Variables panel
2. Select **"Add Collection Variable"**
3. Choose target collection from dropdown
4. Enter variable name and value
5. Variable is instantly available for use in requests

**Benefits:**

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Tab Header Width Optimization

**Tighter, More Efficient Tabs:**
- Reduced left padding from `12px` to `8px`
- Reduced min-width from `60px` to `40px`
- Maximum width limit: `250px` (down from `300px`)
- **Result:** Tabs fit text content better with ~8px space from edge
- More tabs visible in tab bar
- Less wasted space on right side
- Professional, compact appearance

---

### Modernized "Recent" Button 🕐 → Recent

**Before:** Emoji-based button "🕐" (38x38px, rounded)
**After:** Text-based button "Recent" (modern, clean)

**Improvements:**
- **Fixed hover cutoff issue** - Button now renders properly
- Matches style of "New request" button
- Consistent height (35px) with tab bar
- Better readability and accessibility
- Professional text-based design
- Proper alignment and spacing

**Styling:**
- Transparent background with hover effects
- Blue highlight when active (checked state)
- Font: 13px, weight 500, consistent with modern buttons
- Border radius: 3px for subtle corners

---

### Simplified Tooltips (All Panel Toggles)

**Removed Redundant Text:**
- ❌ Old: "Toggle Collections Panel"
- ✅ New: "Collections [Alt+C]"

**All Tooltips Updated:**
- Collections: "Collections [Alt+C]"
- Git Sync: "Git Sync [Alt+G]"
- Variables: "Variables [Alt+V]"
- Environments: "Environments [Alt+E]"
- Request History: "Request History [Alt+H]"
- Settings: "Settings" (no shortcut)

**Benefits:**
- Faster to read
- More informative (includes shortcuts)
- Cleaner, more professional
- Matches panel header names exactly

---

### Removed Bullet Separator in Tabs

**Tab Label Format Changed:**
- **Before:** `GET • New Request` (with bullet separator)
- **After:** `GET New Request` (8px space, no bullet)

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner visual appearance
- More space for request names
- Modern minimalist design
- Easier to read method and name

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fixed Recent Button Hover Cutoff
- **Problem:** Hover effect was cut off at the bottom of the button
- **Cause:** Fixed 38x38px size with emoji caused rendering issues
- **Solution:** Converted to flexible text-based button with proper sizing
- **Result:** Perfect hover effects with no visual artifacts

---

### Improved Signal Blocking During Load
- **Fixed:** Request loading now properly blocks signals to prevent false "modified" state
- **Added:** Signal blocking for test_tab and scripts_tab
- **Result:** Loading saved requests no longer marks them as modified
- **Impact:** Prevents accidental unsaved changes prompts

---

### History Panel Mutual Exclusion
- **Fixed:** History and Recent Requests panels now properly hide each other
- **Result:** Only one right-side overlay visible at a time
- **Impact:** Cleaner UI, no overlapping panels

---
