# PostMini v1.8.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** November 4, 2025

## 🎯 Overview

Version 1.8.0 is a **major UI reorganization release** focused on **vertical space optimization** and **cleaner interface design**. This release removes the top toolbar entirely and consolidates all functionality into a streamlined status bar and reorganized sidebar, giving you more screen space for what matters: testing APIs.

---

## 🎨 Major Changes

### 1. Top Toolbar Removed ✨

**The entire top toolbar has been removed!**

- Gains **~40 pixels of vertical space** for your workspace
- Cleaner, more modern look similar to VS Code and professional IDEs
- All toolbar functionality relocated to more logical locations
- Less visual clutter = better focus on API testing

**What happened to the toolbar buttons?**
- ✅ Environment Selector → Status Bar (bottom)
- ✅ Git Sync Status → Status Bar (bottom)
- ✅ Keyboard Shortcuts Hint → Status Bar (bottom right)
- ✅ Requests History → Left Sidebar Icon
- ✅ Theme Toggle → Hidden (dark theme is default)

---

### 2. Enhanced Status Bar 📊

The bottom status bar is now your **command center** with comprehensive information:

#### Layout (Left to Right):

**Left Side:**
- **Ready** - Save status (shows "✓ Request saved" or "✗ Failed to save")
- **Git: Not Enabled** - Git sync status (or "📁 Git: {workspace}" when active)
- **Environment: {selector}** - Quick environment switching

**Right Side:**
- **💡 Ctrl+/ for shortcuts** - Keyboard shortcuts reminder

#### Improvements:
- ✅ Removed excessive "|" separators for cleaner look
- ✅ Consistent 12px padding throughout
- ✅ Smart color coding: Blue for active items, Gray for passive
- ✅ Eliminated empty blocks from unused widgets
- ✅ Compact environment selector with hover effects
- ✅ Professional styling matching VS Code status bars

---

### 3. Left Sidebar Reorganized 🗂️

**Icons now organized by function:**

**Top Section** (Main Workflow):
- 📁 Collections
- 🔄 Git Sync
- {{}} Variables
- 🌍 Environments
- 📋 **History** ← NEW POSITION!

**Bottom Section** (Configuration):
- ⚙️ **Settings** ← MOVED TO BOTTOM

**Benefits:**
- Related workflow icons grouped together
- Configuration separated from main workflow
- History accessible but not cluttering top area
- Logical top-to-bottom organization

---

### 4. "New Request" Button Enhancement 🆕

**Changed from "+" to "+ New request"**

**Before:**
```
[+]  ← Just a plus sign
```

**After:**
```
[+ New request]  ← Clear label
```

**Why this matters:**
- ✅ More discoverable for new users
- ✅ Clearer purpose (not ambiguous like "+")
- ✅ Better visual hierarchy
- ✅ Consistent with modern UI patterns

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Tab Width Issue Fixed

**Problem:**
When creating a new request, tabs appeared with mysteriously narrow width, cutting off the tab title.

**Solution:**
- Changed default tab size hint from Qt's narrow default to 150px
- Added forced tab bar updates after setting tab data
- Applied fix to all 3 tab creation scenarios:
  - Creating new requests
  - Opening requests from collections
  - Updating tab display

**Result:**
✅ Tabs now always show correct width immediately!

### Status Bar Cleanup

**Removed:**
- Duplicate `status_git_sync_label` (was creating empty blocks)
- Visible spacer widget (was showing as block)
- Redundant git status widgets

**Result:**
✅ Clean status bar with no empty blocks!
✅ All widgets serve a clear purpose!

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This release embodies a key principle:

> **Every pixel counts in an API testing tool.**

Modern development tools (VS Code, IntelliJ, Visual Studio) **maximize vertical space** because:
- You need to see request/response data
- Vertical space is more valuable than horizontal
- Toolbars are expensive real estate
- Status bars are perfect for contextual info

PostMini v1.8.0 follows this philosophy:
- ❌ No wasted space on redundant toolbar
- ✅ Information-dense status bar
- ✅ Compact, efficient layout
- ✅ Professional, modern look

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

None! This release is stable and production-ready.

---

## 📅 What's Next?

Looking ahead to v1.9.0:
- Enhanced request chaining workflows
- Improved test automation features
- More keyboard shortcuts
- Performance optimizations
