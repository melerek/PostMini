**Release Date:** November 5, 2025

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Scripts Tab Dark Theme Colors Fixed ✅

**Problem:**
The Pre-request Script and Post-response Script editors in the Scripts tab were not properly matching the dark theme colors, appearing with incorrect background and text colors even when the dark theme was active.

**Root Cause:**
1. Script editors were initialized during window creation before the theme preference was loaded
2. Theme changes were not being propagated to the script tab editors
3. Hard-coded colors in the CodeEditor widget didn't match the global dark theme palette

**Solution:**
- Updated `CodeEditor` widget to use consistent dark theme colors:
  - Background: `#252526` (matches QTextEdit in dark theme)
  - Text: `#E0E0E0` (matches primary text color)
  - Border: `#2D2D2D` (matches dark theme borders)
  - Selection: `#3A79D0` (matches dark theme selection)
- Updated console output styling to match dark theme consistently
- Added theme update call in `main.py` to apply theme after window initialization
- Added theme update call in `_toggle_theme()` to update script editors when theme is toggled

**Result:**
✅ Script editors now display with correct dark theme colors from startup
✅ Console output matches the dark theme
✅ Theme changes apply immediately to script editors when toggling
✅ Complete theme consistency across all UI elements
