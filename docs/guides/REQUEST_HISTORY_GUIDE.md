## Use Cases

### 1. Debugging Failed Requests

**Scenario:** API call failed, need to investigate

**Steps:**
1. Open History
2. Filter: **"Failed Requests"**
3. Find the failed request
4. Click to view details
5. Check error message in Response tab
6. Fix issue and replay

**Example:**
```
Status: 401
Error: Unauthorized - Invalid API token

Solution: Update API token in headers and replay
```

### 2. Performance Analysis

**Scenario:** Check if API is getting slower

**Steps:**
1. Open History
2. Filter: **"All Requests"**
3. Look at **Time (s)** column
4. Compare recent vs older requests
5. Identify slow endpoints

**Example:**
```
Same endpoint:
Yesterday: 0.234s
Today: 1.523s
‚Üí Performance degradation detected!
```

### 3. Reproducing Issues

**Scenario:** User reports error, can't reproduce

**Steps:**
1. Open History
2. Find the exact request from that time
3. View full request details
4. Replay with same parameters
5. See the actual error

**Example:**
```
User: "Create user failed"
History shows:
  POST /users
  Body: {"name": "John@Doe"}
  Status: 400
  Error: Invalid email format
‚Üí Issue found and fixed!
```

### 4. Testing Different Scenarios

**Scenario:** Test same endpoint with different params

**Steps:**
1. Send request with params A
2. Send request with params B
3. Send request with params C
4. Open History
5. Compare all three responses
6. Choose best approach

### 5. Sharing with Team

**Scenario:** Show teammate exact request that worked

**Steps:**
1. Open History
2. Find successful request
3. Take screenshot or:
4. Replay ‚Üí Save as new request
5. Export collection
6. Share with team

## Advanced Tips

### Tip 1: Quick Success Check
```
Filter: Successful (2xx)
Look for: Your latest test
If found: Request working!
If not found: Check Failed Requests filter
```

### Tip 2: Performance Baseline
```
Before changes:
  - Record average response time
  
After changes:
  - Compare with history
  - Identify regressions
```

### Tip 3: Error Pattern Detection
```
Filter: Failed Requests
Sort by: Time
Pattern: Multiple 500 errors in row
‚Üí Server might be down!
```

### Tip 4: API Behavior Analysis
```
Same request at different times:
  10:00 AM - Status 200, 0.2s
  12:00 PM - Status 200, 0.5s
  02:00 PM - Status 503, Error
‚Üí Server overload during peak hours
```

## Limitations & Notes

### Storage:
- ‚úÖ Unlimited history entries
- ‚úÖ Large responses truncated to 100KB
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Very large history may slow down queries
- üí° Use "Clear History" periodically

### What's NOT Saved:
- ‚ùå Actual response images/files
- ‚ùå Streaming responses
- ‚ùå WebSocket connections
- ‚úÖ Everything else is saved!

### Privacy:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sensitive data (tokens, passwords) IS saved
- ‚ö†Ô∏è History stored in local database

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: History dialog empty

**Possible Causes:**
1. No requests sent yet
2. History was cleared
3. Filter too restrictive

**Solutions:**
- Send a request first
- Change filter to "All Requests"
- Check total count in top-right

### Issue: Can't replay request

**Possible Causes:**
1. No row selected
2. Corrupted history entry

**Solutions:**
- Click a row first
- Check Request tab for data
- Try different entry

### Issue: Missing response body

**Possible Causes:**
1. Response was empty
2. Response was too large (truncated)
3. Error occurred before response

**Solutions:**
- Check Response tab for details
- Look for "(truncated)" text
- Check error_message field

### Issue: Slow history loading

**Possible Causes:**
1. Too many history entries (10,000+)
2. Large database file

**Solutions:**
- Clear old history
- Use filters to reduce results
- Consider periodic cleanup

**Q: Does history slow down the app?**  
A: Not noticeably, even with thousands of entries.

**Q: Are variables substituted in history?**  
A: Yes! History saves the actual URL after substitution.

**Q: Can I search history?**  
A: Not yet, but filters help narrow down results.

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:

1. **Regular Review**
   - Check failed requests daily
   - Analyze performance trends weekly

2. **Periodic Cleanup**
   - Clear very old history (6+ months)
   - Especially before sharing database

3. **Use Filters**
   - Don't scroll through everything
   - Use filters to find what you need

4. **Replay for Testing**
   - Instead of retyping requests
   - Faster and more accurate

5. **Debug with History**
   - First place to check for issues
   - Better than relying on memory

### ‚ùå DON'T:

1. **Don't** rely solely on history for backups
   - Use collection export for that

2. **Don't** ignore failed requests
   - They indicate real problems

3. **Don't** let history grow forever
   - Clean up periodically

4. **Don't** share database with sensitive history
   - Clear first or use environment variables

---

## Integration with Other Features

### Works With:

**Environment Variables**
- History saves URLs AFTER variable substitution
- Shows actual endpoints used
- Helps verify variable values

**Collections**
- History tracks which collection request came from
- Filter by collection available
- Doesn't affect saved collection requests

**Export/Import**
- History NOT included in collection exports
- History is local only
- Intentional for privacy

---

## Real-World Example

### Debugging Production Issue:

**Initial Report:**
```
User: "Can't create account"
Time: 2:30 PM
```

**Investigation:**
```
1. Open History
2. Filter: Failed Requests
3. Find 2:30 PM entries
4. See: POST /register
5. Status: 400
6. Response: "Email already exists"
```

**Resolution:**
```
1. Replay request
2. Modify email
3. Send successfully
4. Identify duplicate check issue
5. Fix validation message
6. Test with replay
```

**Time Saved:** 15 minutes of guesswork!
